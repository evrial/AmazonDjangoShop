================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/evrial/AmazonDjangoShop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/evrial/AmazonDjangoShop)

This is a simple Django driven online shop engine using [Amazon Product Advertising API](https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/) as product data source. Running on free Heroku instance with auto deploy from Github.
The API connection is outdated and pip package no longer maintained, so use as example, google search and your brains.
